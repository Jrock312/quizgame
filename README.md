# quizgame

I want to create a quiz game that can calculate a score based on countdown time and correct answers.  It will eventually have a seperate 
Javascript file that can contain different questions so that I can easily update the game for different subjects.

The inital commit is just a simple test that has questions with one answer.  I want to be able to have these randomly generate so that 
the answers are not always in the same place as well as order of questions.

in addition i will be making the game save scores locally.
